## [2.1.2] - 2026-06-18

### Security
- **USB VID/PID cleanup**: Replaced all hardcoded default 3Dconnexion SpaceMouse USB Vendor IDs and Product IDs (`256f` / `c635` / `256F` / `C635`) in code comments, test assertions, and status scripts with generic placeholders (`0xXXXX`, `0xYYYY`, `xxxx:yyyy`) to prevent publishing them.

- **Automatic installer updates**: Modified `linux/install.sh` and `setup.sh` to install environment files and check dependencies.
