# Linapse CAD Mouse — macOS Installation & Quick Start

This guide helps you set up and configure the **CAD Mouse MK2** using **Linapse** on Apple macOS.

---

## How It Works on macOS

macOS does not use UNIX sockets or `udev` rules. Instead:
- **Motion Telemetry** is sent from the CAD Mouse MK2 over the USB Serial interface (COM port) to `linapse-service`.
- **Physical Buttons** are handled as standard USB HID mouse buttons directly from the device's hardware, meaning they do not pass through the host service for custom mapping.
- **Cap-Tap Gestures** are detected by the firmware, sent over USB Serial, and simulated on the host OS by the service using the `pynput` library.
- **Browser CAD Applications** (such as OnShape or SketchUp Web) connect via a WebSocket connection (`ws://localhost:13000`) and a Tampermonkey userscript.

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)

1. Download the latest `linapse-service.pkg` installer package directly from the [latest release download link](https://github.com/spikeon/linapse-cad-mouse-v2/releases/latest/download/linapse-service.pkg).
2. Open and run the package installer. This will:
   - Copy the service binary to `/usr/local/bin/linapse-service`.
   - Register a `launchd` launch agent plist at `/Library/LaunchAgents/com.linapse.service.plist`.
3. The launch agent ensures the background service starts automatically when you log into macOS.

### Option 2: Running from Source (Python)

If you prefer to run the daemon manually from source:

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed (usually preinstalled or via Homebrew `brew install python`).
2. Open Terminal and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install websockets pyserial pynput
   ```
3. Run the service:
   ```bash
   python3 service/linapse-service
   ```
4. **Auto-Start on Boot (Optional)**:
   - Create a launch agent plist under `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.linapse.service.plist` pointing to your Python path and the script path.
   - Load the agent:
     ```bash
     launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.linapse.service.plist
     ```

## Required macOS Permissions

> [!CAUTION]
> **Accessibility Permissions**: macOS security policies block standard scripts from simulating keyboard or mouse inputs.
> To allow tap gestures and other custom macro actions to work:
> 1. When the service first runs and attempts to simulate a keypress, macOS will display an "Accessibility Access" prompt.
> 2. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**.
> 3. Add and toggle **ON** the program running the service:
>    - If running the pre-compiled installer: Enable `/usr/local/bin/linapse-service`.
>    - If running from source: Enable **Terminal** (or your terminal emulator of choice).

## Browser CAD Connector Setup (OnShape & SketchUp Web)

Browser-based CAD tools sandbox network connections. To bridge the CAD Mouse MK2 to OnShape or SketchUp Web, install the browser userscript connector:

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension for Chrome, Edge, Safari, or Firefox.
2. Download or open [linapse-browser-connector.user.js](https://github.com/spikeon/linapse-cad-mouse-v2/raw/main/service/linapse-browser-connector.user.js) in your browser.
3. Tampermonkey should automatically prompt you to install the script. Click **Install**.
4. Open or refresh OnShape (`https://cad.onshape.com`) or SketchUp Web. The device will be recognized immediately, allowing 6DoF camera motion.

## Tuning with the Web Configurator

The configurator is a static web app that interfaces with `linapse-service` over WebSocket (`ws://localhost:13000`):

1. Serve the `configurator/` directory using any static web server. For example:
   ```bash
   cd configurator
   python3 -m http.server 7890
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:7890` in Safari, Chrome, or Firefox.
3. Ensure the indicator in the top-left reads **CONNECTED** (red dot).
4. Use the **Sensitivity** tab to adjust dead zones, Kalman filters, and axes inversion in real time. Use the **Lighting** tab to configure the SK6812 LED ring.

## Customization Differences on macOS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Physical Buttons**: Because the device functions as a native HID mouse, the **Customize** tab's remappings for **Left Button**, **Right Button**, and the **Chord** (both buttons) will **not** be intercepted by the host service. They will trigger standard OS mouse clicks.
> - **Taps & Gestures**: Taps (Top Tap, Front Tap, Back Tap, Left Tap, Right Tap) *are* processed by the service and can be bound to key combinations, mouse clicks, scrolls, macros, and profile modes.
