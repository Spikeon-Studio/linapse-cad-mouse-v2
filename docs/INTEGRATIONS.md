## Native Linux Applications

Native Linux applications connect to the local SpaceMouse daemon via `libspnav`.

### Prerequisites
1. Run `./setup.sh` or `linux/install.sh`. This installs the systemd environment config at `~/.config/environment.d/99-spnav.conf`.
2. **You must log out and back in** (or reboot) to apply this environment configuration to your desktop environment.
3. Verify that the env variable is active: `echo $SPNAV_SOCKET`. It should output `/run/user/<UID>/spnav.sock`.

### Application Configuration

#### Blender
- Connection: Automatic.
- Setup:
  1. Open Blender.
  2. Navigate to `Edit -> Preferences -> Input -> NDOF`.
  3. Enable and tune NDOF settings (sensitivity, pan/zoom options).

#### Bambu Studio
- Connection: Automatic.
- Setup:
  1. Open Bambu Studio.
  2. Go to `Preferences` and verify 3D Mouse is enabled.

#### FreeCAD
- Connection: Automatic.
- Setup:
  1. Open FreeCAD.
  2. Go to `Edit -> Preferences -> Display -> 3D Navigation`.
  3. Ensure navigation style or "Spaceball" is enabled.

#### OpenSCAD
- Connection: Automatic.
- Setup:
  1. Go to `Edit -> Preferences -> Input` to enable and configure the 3D mouse.

#### Autodesk Maya
- Connection: Plugin-based.
- Setup:
  1. Open Maya.
  2. Open the Plug-in Manager via `Window -> Settings/Preferences -> Plug-in Manager`.
  3. Check the `Loaded` and `Auto Load` checkboxes for the 3Dconnexion plugin.

#### Substance 3D Painter
- Connection: Automatic.
- Setup:
  1. Open Substance 3D Painter and tune navigation under preferences.

## Browser / Web Applications

Web applications run in sandboxed browsers and cannot read the UNIX socket. They communicate via the `spacenav-ws` WebSocket proxy (port 8181).

### Setup Steps
1. Make sure `spacenav-ws` is running: `systemctl --user status spacenav-ws`.
2. Install the **Tampermonkey** extension in your browser.
3. Install the userscript `linux/linapse-browser-connector.user.js` (by dragging it onto the Tampermonkey dashboard).
   - This script spoofs `navigator.platform` to `'Win32'` and matches `cad.onshape.com` and `*.sketchup.com`.

#### OnShape
- Open any document on `https://cad.onshape.com`. Motion should work instantly.

#### SketchUp Web
- Open a design on `https://sketchup.com` or `https://app.sketchup.com`. Spoofing activates connection to WebSocket proxy.

#### TinkerCAD
- **No official support**.
- Workaround: Use gamepad emulator tools (e.g., `xboxdrv` or a custom browser extension) to map the device to standard mouse/joystick inputs.

## Game Engines

Game engines require plugin-based integrations.

#### Unreal Engine (Native Linux)
1. Download `OpenUnrealSpaceMouse` from GitHub (https://github.com/microcosm/OpenUnrealSpaceMouse).
2. Build and copy the plugin to your project's `Plugins/` folder.
3. Enable under `Edit -> Plugins` in Unreal Editor.
4. Ensure `SPNAV_SOCKET` is exported before launching Unreal Editor.

#### Unity (Native Linux)
1. The Linapse installer sets up udev rules that grant user-read access to `/dev/hidraw*`.
2. Use a C# Unity package (e.g. `Unity-SpaceMouse`) to read raw HID reports.
3. Map HID axes to camera control scripts in your project.

## Wine / Proton (Unsupported)

Applications running under Wine do not support native UNIX sockets natively.

#### ZBrush / 3ds Max / Twinmotion
- **Wine Only**: No native support.
- *Option 1*: Use `wine-spacenavd` socket wrapper to forward the UNIX socket events into Wine.
- *Option 2*: Use raw USB/HID device forwarding in Wine/Proton.
- *Option 3*: Configure custom profiles in the Linapse configurator to map puck movements to hotkeys or mouse clicks.
